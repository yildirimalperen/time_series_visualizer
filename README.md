# time_series_visualizer


In this project, I worked on visualizing time series data using line chart, bar chart, and box chart. 
I used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset of pageviews per day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016 to 2019. 
I tried to understand patterns in visits and identify annual and monthly growth with data visualizations.
