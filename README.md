# time_series_visualizer

In this project I have worked on visualizing time series data, using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots.
I have used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016 to 2019
With the data visualizations I try to understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
